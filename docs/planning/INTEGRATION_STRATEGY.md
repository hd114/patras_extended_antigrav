# Integration Strategy

## Principles
- Integrate early and often.
- Keep interfaces stable and versioned when necessary.
- Avoid long-lived divergence across branches.

## Steps per work item
1. Implement change behind stable interfaces.
2. Add tests and verification steps.
3. Update snapshot.
4. Merge once quality gates are satisfied.
