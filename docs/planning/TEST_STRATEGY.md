# Test Strategy

## Principles
- Prefer deterministic tests.
- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- Cover boundary IO with integration tests.

## Test levels
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End to end tests (if applicable)

## Tooling
- pytest
- coverage (optional)
- type checking and linting as configured
